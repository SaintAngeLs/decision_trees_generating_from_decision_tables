<strong>Build and Run Decision Models</strong> </p>

The workspace “OpenRulesDecisionManager” contains several examples of OpenRules 
projects (decision models) that can be used as prototypes for your own projects:
<ul <ul>
	<li>
		<strong>VacationsDays</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>– this is an example of a basic 
		OpenRules project</li>
		<li>
		<strong>VacationsDaysLambda</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>– this project demonstrates 
		how to deploy the project VacationDays as<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://openrulesdecisionmanager.com/deploying-decision-services/aws-lambda/" >AWS 
		Lambda function</a></li>
		<li>
		<strong>VacationsDaysSpingBoot</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>– this project demonstrates 
		how to deploy the project VacationDays as<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://openrulesdecisionmanager.com/deploying-decision-services/restful-web-services/">RESTfull 
		Web Service</a><span>&nbsp;</span>and how to create a Docker image.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can build and test a decision model by a simple double-click on the file “<strong>test.bat</strong>“.&nbsp; 
For Mac or Linux, use the script-file “<strong>test</strong>“. 
When you try it for the first time, you may need to confirm that it’s safe to 
execute this script. If you make any changes in your Excel tables or 
configuration files, it will automatically re-build the model before running its 
tests. If it finds any errors, it will display them using the business terms 
pointing to the corresponding places in your Excel files. </p>
<p>After the successful 
build, “<strong>test.bat</strong>” 
will test your model against test-cases described in the file “Test.xls”.&nbsp; 
When you execute the decision model, the Decision Manager produces a 
user-friendly execution protocol and explanation reports in the HTML format in 
the generated folder “<strong>"report</strong>“.</p>
